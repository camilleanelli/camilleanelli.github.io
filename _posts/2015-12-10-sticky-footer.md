title: How to make a sticky footer?
---

I had often this problem during my last project: you don't have enough content and your footer don't want to stick to the bottom.  
To resolve this issue, I think the best way is to use a flex property:                                                             

###In the CSS, on the body or principal container:
![css](/images/article3.png)


###On the row, the content:
![css](/images/sticky-footer.png)

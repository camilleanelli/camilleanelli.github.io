#####I’m not ashamed to tell that I spend so many times to find a solution with this filter, because when I gave an opacity to it, every child elements had the same opacity, so that’s why I would like to right this, even it is simple for lot of people:

###In your html:
![Text editor](/images/filterhtml.png)

###In your CSS:
![Text editor](/images/filtercss.png)


#####So the opacity between the curly braces of rgba color value, is necessary to apply it only to the filter. I hope it will help you.

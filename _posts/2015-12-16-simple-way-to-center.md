## Center an element, using Flex-box CSS

___
I think the best way to center an element is to use flex-box.
For example, we need to center a title in a beautiful home page.

### In your html

### In your css

The container parent of the item(s), must have the proporty/value, display: flex

Then there is many simple solutions to center your element:

#### => Apply the solution only on the container
